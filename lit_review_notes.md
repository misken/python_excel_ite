Teaching Data Science
==================================================

Robert J. Brunner 1 and Edward J. Kim (UIUC) - 2016

Intro Python based course. No programming prereq. Students from many majors.

Course materials at https://github.com/UI-DataScience/info490-sp15

Docker image

Goal was broad but not deep

Started out with basic Unix and CLI intro - 2 weeks
Intro to Python - 2 weeks
Data viz
Stats and time series
Data formats
Data persistence
ML intro
Intro to HPC and cloud computing

Peer grading and some automated grading
MC quizzes

Difficulties related to the range of backgrounds of students. Too hard for some students, too easy for others.
Decided to break course into two (basic and advanced) to give more time on the topics.

Some technical issues related to using Docker. Exploring Jupyter hub for future.

Teaching on Jupyter – Using notebooks to accelerate learning and curriculum development
==========================================================================================
Reades, J. 2020

Three geocomputation modules

Discusses revolutionary impact of Jupyter on teaching computational topics.

There are many differing views of how programming should be taught (Pears et al.
2007), though we come down firmly on the side of Lukkarinen, Sorva (2016) that there
are advantages to ‘contextualising programming practice in the field of application’.

!!! This paper looks like it was written in LaTex but includes nicely formatted Jupyter code and output.

They attempted a VMWare with Ubuntu approach but abandoned it.

Teaching optimization of manufacturing problems via code components of a Jupyter Notebook
===========================================================================================
Suarez et al 2018

Formulated and solved diet problem LP using PuLP

BY JUPYTER, IT ALL MAKES SENSE
================================

Perkel, 2018 in Nature

By 2018 emerged as a defacto standard computational notebook in science research and teaching.

Teaching and learning with Jupyter
========================================================

Barba, ..., Downey, ... many more 2019, handbook

Extremely useful handbook for educators using or contemplating using Jupyter notebooks for teaching and learning.

Ch 2 of the handbook describes the why's and what's of Jupyter and makes the case for it based on experience of many educators.

"In short, we design learning environments and experiences."

"Jupyter is a free, open source platform that is an excellent learning environment for students."

Based on the experience developing the “CFD Python” learning module (Barba & Forsyth, 2018), this basic design
pattern was adopted for creating lessons using computable content:

- Break it down into small steps
- Chunk small steps into bigger steps
- Add narrative and connect
- Link out to documentation
- Interleave easy exercises
- Spice with challenge questions/tasks
- Publish openly online

This was particularly helpful for student understanding.

Ch 3 provides a high level overview of how Jupyter notebooks can be used for teaching and learning and provides numerous reflective opportunities for educators considering adoption of notebooks for some aspect of their classes.

Ch 4 is a catalog of pedagogical patterns for using Jupyter

Jupyter grant proposal
=======================

Added some material from this as notes and content in doc with cite.

Easy-to-Use Cloud Computing for Teaching Data Science
=====================================================

Binder + GitHub based approach
