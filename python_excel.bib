  abstract = {Become a master of data analysis, modeling, and spreadsheet use with BUSINESS ANALYTICS: DATA ANALYSIS AND DECISION MAKING, 6E! This popular quantitative methods text helps you maximize your success with its proven teach-by-example approach, student-friendly writing style, and complete Excel 2016 integration. (It is also compatible with Excel 2013, 2010, and 2007.) The text devotes three online chapters to advanced statistical analysis. Chapters on data mining and importing data into Excel emphasize tools commonly used under the Business Analytics umbrella -- including Microsoft Excel\dbend s \dbend Power BI\dbend{} suite. Up-to-date problem sets and cases demonstrate how chapter concepts relate to real-world practice. In addition, the Companion Website includes data and solutions files, PowerPoint slides, SolverTable for sensitivity analysis, and the Palisade DecisionTools Suite (@RISK, BigPicture, StatTools, PrecisionTree, TopRank, RISKOptimizer, NeuralTools, and Evolver).},

  abstract = {This essay discusses how we can most effectively teach Management Science to students in MBA or similar programs who will be, at best, part-time practitioners of these arts. I take as a working hypothesis the radical proposition that the heart of Management Science itself is not the impressive array of tools that have been built up over the years (optimization, simulation, decision analysis, queuing, and so on) but rather the art of reasoning logically with formal models. I believe it is necessary with this group of students to teach basic modeling skills, and in fact it is only when such students have these basic skills as a foundation that they are prepared to acquire the more sophisticated skills needed to employ Management Science. In this paper I present a hierarchy of modeling skills, from numeracy skills through sophisticated Management Science skills, as a framework within which to plan courses for the occasional practitioner.},
