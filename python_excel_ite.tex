\section{Introduction}

% The opening part of the what-if notebook has some language for the motivation behind this module.

Why I created 

Excel is widely used for building and using models of business problems to explore the impact of various model inputs on key outputs. Built in "what if?" tools such as Excel [Data Tables](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/calculate-multiple-results-by-using-a-data-table-e95e2487-6ca6-4413-ad12-77542a5ea50b) and [Goal Seek](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-goal-seek-to-find-the-result-you-want-by-adjusting-an-input-value-320cb99e-f4a4-417f-b1c3-4f369d6e66c7) are well known to power spreadsheet modelers. How might we do similar modeling and analysis using Python? 

While Python has been gaining momentum in the business analytics world, it is often used for data wrangling, analysis and visualization of tablular data using tools like pandas and matplotlib or Seaborn. You can find some great examples at [Chris Moffit's Practical Business Python blog](https://pbpython.com/). I use Python all the time for such tasks and teach a course called [Practical Computing for Data Analytics](http://www.sba.oakland.edu/faculty/isken/courses/mis5470/) that is Python (and R) based. But, it got me to thinking. What about those things for which Excel is well suited such as building formula based models and doing sensitivity analysis on these models? What would those look like in Python?

\section{Student assignment}

\section{Random notes}
Learning good Python programming practices via learning to model in similar way that students learn good spreadsheet practices through building spreadsheet models using the W\&A textbook.

How aap course fits in relation to pcda course. Could also be second part of a fully Python based course. Builds on basic intro Python concepts and skills.

The Quant Econ website is a good example of another use of Python for typical Excel things.
